# Blackjack
A realistic game of blackjack. Has all of the functions in the game, but you can only split once. Starting balance is 500, and updates as you play. If you are bankrupt, balance resetsto 500.
# Use of A.I
I used A.I to create the file to save your balance because I didn't know how to. I also used A.I to spot any bugs, but I fixed those myself.
